    <p>I am an environmental engineer with research experience about precipitation, 
    earth observation and hydrology. 
    <br>
    In order to link such background with data analysis and technology interests I switched my job activity to data science.
    <br>
    In my opinion blending geosciences and technolgoy competences is one of the keyes for dealing with innovation challenges 
    related to value exploitation from geoscience data, facilitating sustainable solutions, and contributing to climate awareness.
